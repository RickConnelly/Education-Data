// This research aims to examine the reimplementation of additional funding support for school districts after the 2011 decision in the NJ Supreme Court case Abbot v. Burke. These school districts are of extremely low socioeconomic status and thus have failing schools since school funding in New Jersey is tied to property value. Originally decided in 1985 these schools lost their additional funding in the wake of the recession, where the first cut in many state budgets were state aid to school districts. Once the economy began to recover Abbot v. Burke was reintroduced and such the original 31 school districts were regranted additional funding as a means to ensure the NJ consitutional right to a rigorous and thorough education.  

// My attmempt with this code is examine whether or not this extra funding since 2011 has impacted student achievement to any degree compared to those not recieving additioanl funding. I expect to find that it has not meaningfully impacted student achievement as previous studies have not shown much change. However to my knowledge since the 2011 court ruling little research has been done into whether or not these school districts have exhibited any change other than the original findings. Using student test scores, graduation rates, and possibly student attendence I will attempt to find any relationship between student achievement in Abbot School Districts compared to non-Abott School Districts.

Interestingly, the demographic that scored the lowest are migrant students. Initally I had wondered if the reason behind this was that the tests were only administered in English. However, further research shows PARCC testing is adminstered in 10 languages suggesting the test was adminstered in the migrant student's native language.
